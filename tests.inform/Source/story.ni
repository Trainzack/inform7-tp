	now the left hand status line is "tenpo ni li [time of day in words]";

A fruit is a kind of thing. A fruit translates into tokipona as kili.

In tomo suli is a ijo.
A backdrop called nena weka is in tomo suli.
In tomo suli is a supa and a poki. A ilo suno is on supa.
The poki is openable and closed.
A poki telo is in poki.

tomo lili is north of tomo suli.


jan Nasin is a person in tomo. jan Ili carries ilo toki.

Every turn:
	if the player carries tu kili:
		end the story finally.
		
After taking inventory:
	try jan nasin taking inventory.
	


[Tomo lili is sewi of Tomo Suli.]


Test me with "go / take me / take kili / i / take ijo / i / take kili".
